## 📌 Data Collection

The extension does **not** collect or transmit any personal data to external servers.

All data used by the extension (including profiles, mappings, and preferences) is stored locally on the user’s device using browser‑provided storage (`chrome.storage.local` or equivalent).

We do not:

- Collect analytics
- Track browsing history
- Sell or share any personal data
- Use remote code or external script loading

## 📌 Data Usage

Data is used only to:

- Autofill fields on websites at the user’s request
- Store user profiles and preferences
- Remember per‑site rules and mappings

All processing happens locally in the browser.  
No data is transmitted to third‑party services.
